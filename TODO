Master list of known bugs and feature requests
===
BUG2 v1.02

The experimental function rectpara-move-rectpara
has bugs in recursive collision avoidance that edit/done does not
have.  Sometimes works, but sometimes runs two rectparas so close
they merge.

===
FEATURE

I frequently use these picture-mode rectangle commands
as "cut" and "paste"

C-c C-w C-a
C-c C-x C-a

Those are bound to:

   picture-clear-rectangle-to-register
   picture-yank-rectangle-from-register

And I usually use them after:

   rectpara-select-rectpara

(Note: this uses the C-a register as a "clipboard".
That means you can just hold Control down on all three keystrokes.)

Arguably, rectpara.el should have it's own version of "paste",
which uses the same collision avoidance code used by
rectpara-edit-done.

With a rectpara "cut" command, this could use something like a
rectpara-kill-ring, rather than a register.

===
FEATURE

A useful rectpara formatting command would be to "balance lines":
choose an aspect ratio that reduces the raggedness of the right
margin.

===
TODO

Investigate how this package, which is supposed to highlight
rectangles, works with this one:

   rect-mark.el
