Master list of known bugs and feature requests

===
FEATURE

I frequently use these picture-mode rectangle commands
as "cut" and "paste"

C-c C-w C-a
C-c C-x C-a

Those are bound to:

   picture-clear-rectangle-to-register
   picture-yank-rectangle-from-register

And I usually use them after:

   rectpara-select-rectpara

(Note: this uses the C-a register as a "clipboard".
That means you can just hold Control down on all three keystrokes.)

Arguably, rectpara.el should have it's own version of "paste",
which uses the same collision avoidance code used by
rectpara-edit-done.

With a rectpara "cut" command, this could use something like a
rectpara-kill-ring, rather than a register.

===
FEATURE

Common operations in finishing up the layout of rectparas
involve a lot of edit-reformat-return cycles.  Individual
commands should exist to move the right margin without explicitly
invoking a rectpara-edit buffer.

Another useful command would be to "balance lines": choose an
aspect ratio that reduces the raggedness of the right margin.

===
TODO

Investigate how this package, which is supposed to highlight
rectangles, works with this one:

   rect-mark.el
